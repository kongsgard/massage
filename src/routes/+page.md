# Massage

## Basic Guidelines

1. **Opening preparations:** Center yourself by breathing, relexing, and quieting yourself. Ask person how they are doing, what kind of pressure they like, and ask them to tell you if anything feels uncomfortable.

2. **Intention:** Set an intention into motion by saying to yourself, "May I be tuned into what this person needs. May this be healing for them and myself. May I end feeling more relaxed and energized."

3. **Ending:** Complete the massage by stroking lightly down the person's body. Balance and clear your own body by physically or mentally doing the same. Rinsing your hands and splashing your face with water may also be used to cool and refresh you.

## Beginning Techniques

**Effleurage** - A slow, smooth beginning, ending, and transitional stroke. Used to encourage blood and lymph circulation towards the heart.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apply with full contact to cover a broad area. Use two hands down either side of the spine, use two hands which face one another when effleuraging arm and leg/thigh. Massage towards the heart.

**Petrissage** - A medium depth stroke which relaxes muscles by separating muscle fibers which increases blood flow and nutrition to the muscles.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use finger(s), thumbs, hand, heel of hand, or knuckles with a circular, straight, or pulling motion. Do simultaneously, or alternate strokes.

**Kneading** - A light to medium depth stroke. Used light, it will have a quiet and soothing effect on the nervous system. Slow and deep - it will help release muscles contraction. Done briskly - it will be more stimulating.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use entire hands to alternately grasp and squeeze (not pinch) bunches of fless with a smooth and flowing rhrythm. One hand releasing it's hold as the other starts to gather a new handful. Move your body slightly from side to side.

**Feather stroke** - A very light, gliding movement with a sedative effect. Used to end a massage, break contact, or as a transitional stroke.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apply in an outward and downward movement from the heart. Use two hands side by side, or alternate hands or fingertips.
