# Massage

## Basic Guidelines

1. **Opening preparations:** Center yourself by breathing, relexing, and quieting yourself. Ask person how they are doing, what kind of pressure they like, and ask them to tell you if anything feels uncomfortable.

2. **Intention:** Set an intention into motion by saying to yourself, "May I be tuned into what this person needs. May this be healing for them and myself. May I end feeling more relaxed and energized."

3. **Ending:** Complete the massage by stroking lightly down the person's body. Balance and clear your own body by physically or mentally doing the same. Rinsing your hands and splashing your face with water may also be used to cool and refresh you.

## Beginning Techniques

**Effleurage** - A slow, smooth beginning, ending, and transitional stroke. Used to encourage blood and lymph circulation towards the heart.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apply with full contact to cover a broad area. Use two hands down either side of the spine, use two hands which face one another when effleuraging arm and leg/thigh. Massage towards the heart.

**Petrissage** - A medium depth stroke which relaxes muscles by separating muscle fibers which increases blood flow and nutrition to the muscles.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use finger(s), thumbs, hand, heel of hand, or knuckles with a circular, straight, or pulling motion. Do simultaneously, or alternate strokes.

**Kneading** - A light to medium depth stroke. Used light, it will have a quiet and soothing effect on the nervous system. Slow and deep - it will help release muscles contraction. Done briskly - it will be more stimulating.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Use entire hands to alternately grasp and squeeze (not pinch) bunches of fless with a smooth and flowing rhrythm. One hand releasing it's hold as the other starts to gather a new handful. Move your body slightly from side to side.

**Feather stroke** - A very light, gliding movement with a sedative effect. Used to end a massage, break contact, or as a transitional stroke.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Apply in an outward and downward movement from the heart. Use two hands side by side, or alternate hands or fingertips.

## Creating a Comfortable Massage Experience

Work in a warm, peaceful environment on a comfortable yet firm surface. Ensure that you are relaxed and at ease while giving a massage. Keep your back straight, and use your body's weight and movement to create depth and rhythm. Move from your center and keep your hands relaxed. The attention you give to your own comfort will translate into a more soothing experience for the person receiving the massage.

Concentrate on the massage and sensations rather than engaging in continuous conversation. Be present and attuned to the whole person â€” physically, emotionally, mentally, and spiritually.

Feel the tissues underlying the skin (texture and consistency of muscles, hard or soft spots, warmth, coolness, aliveness, denseness, etc.). Explore and define underlying structure and question yourself, "What is this?"

Vary pressure according to need. Relaxation is a gradual process. If you're receiving a massage it helps to communicate what feels good and when the pressure is too much or not enough. When massaging ask "Is that pressure ok?" to facilitate communication and greater relaxation.

Begin with light pressure, gradually increase to deeper strokes, and finish with light strokes. Start with large areas, then smaller focused areas, always ending with larger strokes which give the body a sense of oneness.

If you don't know what to do next, just repeat a rhythmic stroke. Don't worry or try too hard; almost all touch feels good. Maintain consistent contact throughout the massage, transitioning smoothly between strokes. If you need to break contact, do so gently.

When applying oil, pour it into the palm of one hand while resting it on the person's body. Distribute to the other hand and use long even pressured strokes, contouring into the body using full hands.

Imagine sculpting the body with your hands - opening up and clearing pathways of blood, lymph, and nerve flow. Feel muscles as they soften under your touch. Spend a little extra time on hard, stiff, or sore areas which may need more attention. If area is too sensitive, work on areas adjacent to it. Ticklishness is usually caused by nervous tension. Go slower using the flat part of your hand with form, broad strokes. Pay attention to your breathing, and encourage the person to release additional tension by breathing or sighing.

Avoid massage in cases of fever, on acute inflammations, skin infections, varicose veins, cancers, tumors, or ulcers. Avoid massaging the abdomen during menstruation, pregnancy, or if the person has hypertension.

Take time to study anatomy and become familiar with the bones and muscles of the body.

Have fun and enjoy!
